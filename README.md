# Swift Colored Squares
This project was my first ever attempt at OSX development in Swift 3. I created a simple *drawing* application for Mac. This project was only meant to me an experiment, and I found some requirements in order to attempt to meet them at the end.

I allocated only 7 days in order to attempt this project. 

### Note
Please note that this app was build during a rapid prototype session that I was undergoing, I was inexperienced to OSX development as well as swift at the time. It was definitely a learning process as I developed it, and I am constantly learning. Any updates, if any are an attempt to make fixes.

## Requirements
Create an NSView subclass RVCustomView which has the following configurable attributes: 

**Border:**
- Thickness 
- Color 
- Individually toggle on/off the Top, Left, Bottom, Right border or all 

**Fill**: 
- Single configurable color 
- Gradient from top to bottom using 2 configurable colors 

**Views:**
- The app must be a single window with the view centered with some margin around it.
- The app should contain UI Controls in the view to change all the attributes. 
- The view should maintain a margin, but still resize with the window. 
- The window must be laid out using AutoLayout format.

## Legacy & Acceptance Criteria
**Border:**
- [x] Thickness 
- [x] Color 
- [x] Individually toggle on/off the Top, Left, Bottom, Right border or all - *Though, not quite working perfectly*
